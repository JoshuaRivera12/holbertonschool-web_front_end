# Welcome to the HTML Advanced Project!

In this project, you will learn how to use HTML tags to structure a web page. No CSS, no styling—don’t worry, the final page will be “ugly.” That’s normal since styling is not the purpose of this project.

## Important Note
Details are important! Be careful with lowercase vs uppercase, incorrect letters, and other small mistakes.

- [HTML 5.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/)
